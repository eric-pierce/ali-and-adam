Look of the website:
Our wedding colors: 
	Black, White and Gold. Maybe it would be cool for the website to follow this structure? I don't know... Just a thought.
Font/Style: 
	I figured we could experiment with this... but here are my initial thoughts: Headers in cursive and then Details in Regular like Tahoma font....like this:

Our Story:
	[maybe put this on the main page]

How we met:
	We met on a cold Saturday Chicago afternoon in February at an Indiana University bar: Joe's on Weed Street. Indiana's Men Basketball team was playing our biggest rival: Purdue. Ali was with her good girl friends from college while Adam was with his guy friends celebrating his upcoming birthday. Our tables were next to each other, we started talking to one another and just clicked. Ali had to patiently wait 10 days for Adam to finally ask her out on a date... but after the rest is history!
How we got engaged:
	Well, Adam pulled off a major surprise! The months leading up to their engagement were full of Ali thinking a proposal was close to happening, but Adam always throwing her off. As a result, Ali was completely caught off guard when Adam got down on one knee. Adam proposed to Ali on the rooftop of their condo building which overlooks the city of Chicago. We spent the day celebrating with Ali's immediately family and flew to New Jersey to celebrate with Adam's family days later.
